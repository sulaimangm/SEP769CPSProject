Abstract:
This project simulates the working of an automated car wash system that uses sensors, actuators, and a cloud (Blynk) platform. The integration of these components enables real-time monitoring, precise control, and efficient operation of the car washing and drying process. By utilizing sensor data and actuator control, the system optimizes the cleaning procedure for different vehicle types. The cloud platform shows real-time statuses of the entire process. Results demonstrate the system's ability to streamline the car wash process and deliver consistent results. The findings will contribute to the field of automated car wash systems and provide insights for further advancements in smart car wash technology using deep learning technologies.
